# Logics For Learning

A sandbox for educational prototypes using different logics to understand mathematical and computational topics.

## Methodology

- Create restricted implementations of logics with simple control methods suitable for web and mobile
- Attempt to teach a range of subjects, Logic, Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, and Programming Language Theory
- Connect excersises with career outcomes in Data Science, Software Engineering, and Machine Learning
